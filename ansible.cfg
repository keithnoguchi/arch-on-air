# This is the default number of parallel processes to spawn when
# communicating with remote hosts. Since Ansible 1.3, the fork number
# is automatically limited to the number of possible hosts at runtime,
# so this is really a limit of how much network and CPU load you think
# you can handle. Many users may set this to 50, some set it to 500 or
# more. If you have a large number of hosts, higher values will make
# actions across all of those hosts complete faster. The default is
# very very conservative:

# x48 from the default conservative setting, as we did migrated
# SFO1 part 1 with 220 (x44) and didn't encounter any challenges
# both on network as well as ansible processing wise.  And also,
# we've put the `ignore_errors = yes` to all the slack related
# tasks so that, the play will keep running even if we hit the
# slack API rate limit.
